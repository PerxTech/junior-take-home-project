# Take Home Project for Junior Software Engineers

## Project

Create a web application where a user can view and submit books to a database.

## Insturctions

This project should take 2-4 hours. Use whatever programming language/framework that is most comfortable to you. The deliverable product should be the source code to a runnable application. It's better if you can put the source code on Github. Place any special setup instructions in a textfile called Setup.txt. You are more than welcome to make any necessary assumptions where necessary.

## Deliverables

### Homepage

The homepage should contain a list view of the books that have been added to the database along with the name of the book, the brief description, the name of the author and the ratings. The name of the book should link to the book's details page.

**Input form**
A simple input form for adding a book to the database. The form should have inputs for the name of the book, the author of the book, the brief description and the ratings of the book.

### Detail View

The detail view should just display the particulars about the book.
